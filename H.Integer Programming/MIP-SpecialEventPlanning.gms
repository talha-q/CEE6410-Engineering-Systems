This problem was contributed by Dr. Ran Sun and expanded by Dr. David Rosenberg

Learning objectives.
Students will be able to:
•   Define dimensions, decision variables and an objective function;
•   Formulate demand, capacity, and service-quality constraints;
•   Solve a small linear program;
•   Identify constraints;

Problem Statement
State Department of Transportation guidance for special events emphasizes advance parklotanning for transportation demand, traffic, parking, transit operations, and seating.

Passengers must also be assigned in full bus-loads of 50 passengers per bus.

Additionally, the event parklotanners must rent and bring in grandstands for the attendees. They have 2 potential venders. Each vender has an up-front reservation cost, number of seats per grandstand, and cost to load, ship, and setup a grandstand.

Vendor  Reservation cost ($)    Seats per grandstand    Cost to load, ship, and setup ($ per grandstand)
PurpleRain $1,000                   100                 200
Blue Sky    $1,500                  200                 300
